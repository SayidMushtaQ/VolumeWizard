## Volume Formulas

### Cone Volume
The volume \( V \) of a cone is calculated using the formula:
\[ V = \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h \]
where:
- \( r \) is the radius of the base
- \( h \) is the height of the cone

### Cylinder Volume
The volume \( V \) of a cylinder is calculated using the formula:
\[ V = \pi r^2 h \]
where:
- \( r \) is the radius of the base
- \( h \) is the height of the cylinder

### Sphere Volume
The volume \( V \) of a sphere is calculated using the formula:
\[ V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 \]
where:
- \( r \) is the radius of the sphere

## How to Use

1. Enter the required dimensions (radius and height) for the shape you want to calculate the volume for.
2. Click the "Calculate" button.
3. View the calculated volume displayed in the results section.
